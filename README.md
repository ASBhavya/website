# Budget for Open Source

Companies enable us, as designers and engineers, to do what we love. Yet a big part of the critical infrastructure (open source software) that we and our companies rely on, is unfunded and unsustainable.

Companies readily pay for things like lawyers, insurance, hosting, free lunches, wellness facilities. But, with very few exceptions, no one pays for open source.

**We believe this won't change until funding for open source is on the budget.**

**So we're asking companies that employ engineers to add a line item to their budget for open source, starting with just \$100 per engineer per year.**

If we can get just 1% of professional software engineers to have a budget like this, we can make a meaningful dent in the sustainability of open source software.

This initiative was launched at ReactConfAU 2020 in a talk by @Jed Watson.

Below is a list of companies that have committed line items on their budgets to support open source.

If your company has a budget of \$100 or more per engineer per year, or you meaningfully contribute in other ways to open source, you also qualify for the list. Please submit a PR to be added.
